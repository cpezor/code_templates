This is my bibliography file for bibtex/biblatex.

I keep all the sources I've quoted since 2015 in this document. Recently, I've started to add comments and summaries.

@book{,
  author = "<++>",
  year = "<++>",
  title = "<++>",
  publisher = "<++>",
  }
  <++>

@article{,
  author = "<++>",
  year = "<++>",
  title = "<++>",
  journal = "<++>",
  volume = "<++>",
  pages = "<++>",
  }
  <++>

@misc{<++>,
    title = "<++>",
    author = "<++>",
    year = "<++>"
    }

@phdthesis{<++>,
    title = "<++>",
    author = "<++>",
    year = "<++>",
    school = "<++>"
    }
